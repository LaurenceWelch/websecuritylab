        In server.js, the entire frontend folder is being served via the code:
        <code>app.use(express.static("frontend"))</code>
        Although secrets.html is not explicitly served, because it resides in
        the frontend folder, it is viewable, click the link and note the url.
        Always check you're not serving files that shouldn't be served.
