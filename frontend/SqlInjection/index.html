      <h1 id="demo">Sql Injection</h1>
      <p>
        (under construction) In this example, you can get information about a
        user. Try typing this:
        <code>Amy</code>
        Sql injection happens when a hacker is able to send sql code to the
        server, the server fails to whitelist the request, the server builds a
        query based off of the tainted user input and fails to parameterize the
        query, the query is sent to the database, and then bad things happen.
        Try this:
        <code></code>
        Solve this problem with the following: #1: Use whitelists on the server
        to validate requests coming from the client. #2: Use parameterization on
        your queries. In Postgres for example you can use prepared statements
        with parameterized queries. When you use parameterization, user input
        won't be treated as sql code.
