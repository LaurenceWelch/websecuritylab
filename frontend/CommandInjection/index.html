      <h1 id="demo">Command Injection</h1>
      <p>
        In this example, the server allows users to echo something. You can try
        to input something like:
        <code>hey you</code>
        The important aspect of this, is that the backend server is executing a
        system command. The backend is taking user input and appending it to the
        command, this is very bad.
        <code> exec("echo " + userinput, (e, stdout, stderr)) </code>
        One feature of system commands is that you can string multiple commands
        together using various symbols. Try these (on windows try dir instead of
        ls):
        <code>yo && ls</code>
        <code>yo && whoami</code>
        Bad right? If you must allow user input driven system commands (but
        why?), carefully validate user input using a whitelist. Additionally,
        the user running the server app should have very limited privileges.
