        What if devious user input is coming from the server/database? Any html
        that consumes this data is at risk. You might have different types of
        users consuming the data using different websites. Escaping bad input is
        always good, but in addition, this data shouldn't ever make it to the
        database! Whitelist all data coming from the client so that unexpected
        input doesn't get inserted into your database. In this example, another
        img tag was inserted into the database because the endpoint didn't use
        validation. Click the button to make a fetch request which will retrieve
        data from the posts database. Solution: validate all input coming from
        the client. Validiation often times includes straight up rejecting user
        input. For a good user experience, validate user input on the client.
        For security, validate user input hitting the server.
